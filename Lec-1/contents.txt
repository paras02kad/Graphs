1.Implementation of unweighted (directed and undirected graph)using adjacency list.
2.Implementation of weighted (directed and undirected graph)using adjacency list.
3.Implementation of above two using hash maps instead of lists.

Traversal techniques:-
1.Given a graph calculate all paths between two vertices.
2.Given a graph find whether a path exists between two vertices or not. (Depth First Search)
